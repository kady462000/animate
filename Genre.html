        <h1>Types of Anime</h1>
        <p>Anime is a storytelling ecosystem unto itself that must be understood as such.
                That's why we're here with a primer on the major genres found in anime, for all your demystification needs.
            Sit back, relax, and prepare to learn about all the different sorts of giant robots a hot-headed teen protagonist can find himself piloting.</p>
          
            <div class="row">
                <div class="Typesofanime-col">
                    <h3>Shoujo</h3>
                    <p>Shonen anime encompasses an enormous variety of subgenres: Sports, fantasy, science fiction, and even horror stories are found beneath this umbrella.
                        They feature wildly different motifs, storylines, and settings, and yet they are both solidly shonen.
                        What unites them, and all shonen anime, is a focus on young men, often seeking to become the best at what they do, to right a terrible wrong, and/or to protect the ones they love.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="Typesofanime-col">       
                    <h3>Seinen</h3>
                    <p>Technically, seinen just boils down to meaning "anime for young men."
                        In practice, this translates to a wide variety of stories that can portray R-rated levels of violence and sexuality, murkier morals, and characters that are not promised any sort of absolution.
                        Though crime, action, psychological horror, and particularly dark takes on science fiction and fantasy are often the order of the day, comedy falls under the seinen umbrella as well.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="Typesofanime-col">
                    <h3>Josei</h3>
                    <p>There's manga for girls, full of first crushes and school-bound secrets, and then there's josei: manga for women who want to go beyond the schoolyard.
                        Josei is where you'll find relationships examined beyond the initial kiss, lives after graduation, and a lot more action between the sheets.
                        Another prominent thread in josei is that of BL stories, or "Boys' Love": romances between male characters that can, within josei's more mature environs, be portrayed with far more explicit sexuality.</p>            
                </div>
                <div class="Typesofanime-col">
                    <h3>Ecchi</h3>
                    <p>There's a major distinction to be mindful of when it comes to ecchi: it's sexy, but it's not pornographic.
                        Oh sure, ecchi anime will refer to sex, even revolve around sex, and is absolutely meant to entice.
                        But ecchi doesn't depict actual, uncensored sex acts, nor is it totally bereft of plot or character development — in fact, there are a great many ecchi series that are as beloved for their world-building and story as for their panty shots and double entendres.</p>    
                </div>
                <div class="Typesofanime-col">
                    <h3>Harem</h3>
                    <p>Typically, harem series center around an average dude, somewhere between 15 and 30.
                        He's likely a little rootless, unsure of what he wants in life, nursing a passion he has yet to properly pursue.
                        Then he finds that he is heir to a fantastic destiny, about to be posted to a job in a girls' school, or simply dials the wrong number, and suddenly his life is crowded with gorgeous girls.
                        All of whom, from the wackiest rabble-rouser to the most demure damsel, want desperately to be with him.</p>  
                </div>
                <div class="Typesofanime-col">   
                    <h3>Isekai</h3>
                    <p>You can't talk about fiction without talking about escapism.
                        Isekai anime takes this to another level by building a genre entirely around ordinary people being whisked away to fantasy worlds.
                        Sometimes they're familiar with the worlds in question, sometimes they're allowed to bring along their smartphone, sometimes they're reincarnated as a slime.
                        But one thing holds true, across trope or plot: they were an ordinary person in our ordinary world, and now, by virtue of being transported to a fantasy land, they have become extraordinary.</p>

                <div class="Typesofanime-col">
                    <h3>Mecha</h3>
                    <p>Mecha anime, the genre to which giant robot anime belongs, is likely what many picture when they think of anime as a whole.
                        Within mecha as a genre, there are "super robot" stories, about enormous humanoid robots with incredible powers, and "real robot" stories, which stick closer to the limitations of our world.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="Typesofanime-col">
                    <h3>Slice of life</h3>
                    <p>It's all in the name, when it comes to slice of life anime: It's a genre containing stories that observe everyday life as it is lived by an individual or group of characters.
                        This is anime that glories in the details, drawing meaning from events as intimate as a single meal or a school ceremony.
                        No one is going Super Saiyan, no one is getting into their 12-story-tall robot.
                        Life is being lived, in whatever form that takes.</p>    
                </div>
                <div class="Typesofanime-col">
                    <h3>Kodomomuke</h3>
                    <p>Many of those unfamiliar with anime might think the entire medium could be described as kid's stuff.
                        Yet even those who understand that Cowboy Bebop and Pretty Cure are very different works of art with very different audiences might not know what kodomomuke anime is. it is, in short, it's the actual kid's stuff, for the youngest viewers out there.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="Typesofanime-col">
                    <h3>Iyashikei</h3>
                    <p>Iyashikei, which means "healing," is a little tricky to describe. Often it overlaps with other genres, especially slice of life, and is more defined by the experience of watching it than the actual story content.
                        Succinctly put, it is anime that soothes you as you watch it.
                        Gorgeously painted backgrounds, gentle scenes of nature, people working together towards a greater goal — that's the stuff of iyashikei, the animated equivalent of a long, hot bath.</p>
